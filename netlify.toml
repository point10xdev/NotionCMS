# Netlify configuration file
# Concept: Netlify uses netlify.toml to configure build settings, deploy rules, and redirects

[build]
  command = "npm run build"       # 📦 Command to build your project (runs before deployment)
  publish = "dist"                # 📂 Directory to deploy as your website (output folder from build)
  functions = "functions"         # 📂 Directory where Netlify will look for serverless functions (API handlers)

# Redirect rules section
# Concept: Netlify redirects map incoming URLs to different destinations, often for APIs or routing

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/*"                 # 🌐 Match any URL starting with /api/
  to = "/.netlify/functions/:splat" # 🔄 Redirect to corresponding function in the functions folder
  status = 200                    # 📡 HTTP status code for the redirect (200 = OK, treat as successful)
